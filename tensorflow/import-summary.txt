ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* BUILD
* README.md
* __init__.py
* jni/
* jni/__init__.py
* jni/imageutils_jni.cc
* jni/jni_utils.cc
* jni/jni_utils.h
* jni/limiting_file_input_stream.h
* jni/rgb2yuv.cc
* jni/rgb2yuv.h
* jni/tensorflow_jni.cc
* jni/tensorflow_jni.h
* jni/yuv2rgb.cc
* jni/yuv2rgb.h

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => android/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* res/ => android/src/main/res/
* src/ => android/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
